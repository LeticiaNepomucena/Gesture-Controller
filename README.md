### GC Mobile

To run the app you have two options:

2. Run it with flutter.



### GC Server

###### Install
To install the the server run install.sh and follow the instructions `bash install.sh`.
<br>
It's important to consider that install the server in other machine (not Liquid Galaxy master) may cause some commands delay between doing a gesture and see it on earth, due the fact that master and server use SSH for communication. For a better experience install the server on master by just leaving the MASTER IP blank in installation process.



###### Test
Inside gcserver folder run server `node index.js`.
